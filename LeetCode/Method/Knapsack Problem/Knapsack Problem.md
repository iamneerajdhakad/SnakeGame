### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Knapsack Problem Approach?**  
The **Knapsack Problem** technique is useful when solving problems that involve **choosing items under constraints** while maximizing a certain value. It is commonly applied in:  

1. **Optimization problems where selecting subsets of elements leads to the best outcome.**  
2. **Budgeting and resource allocation problems (e.g., selecting projects under a budget).**  
3. **Partitioning problems (e.g., checking if an array can be split into equal sum subsets).**  
4. **Subset sum problems (e.g., determining if a subset of elements sums to a target value).**  
5. **Cutting problems (e.g., rod cutting to maximize revenue).**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Use Dynamic Programming (DP) for an efficient O(N Ã— W) solution.**  
- **Use Memoization (Top-Down Approach) to avoid recomputing subproblems.**  
- **Use a Bottom-Up DP table to iteratively compute results (space optimization possible).**  
- **For Unbounded Knapsack problems, use a single DP array (rolling array technique).**  
- **For special cases, use greedy strategies if items have uniform weights and values.**
