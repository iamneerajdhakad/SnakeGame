### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach?**  
The **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** technique is useful when solving **graph traversal, shortest path, and level-order problems** where exploring all neighbors first is required. It is commonly applied in:  

1. **Graph and tree traversal (Level Order Traversal).**  
2. **Finding the shortest path in an **unweighted** graph.**  
3. **Solving pathfinding problems in mazes, grids, and graphs.**  
4. **Detecting cycles in an undirected graph.**  
5. **Finding the number of connected components in a graph.**  
6. **Solving problems like minimum moves in a game or word ladder transformations.**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Use a queue (FIFO) to store nodes for exploration.**  
- **Mark visited nodes to prevent infinite loops.**  
- **Use BFS for the shortest path in an **unweighted** graph (Dijkstraâ€™s for weighted graphs).**  
- **Use BFS for level-wise traversal (e.g., tree level order traversal).**
