### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)?**  
**Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm** is used to find a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** in a **connected, undirected graph** with weighted edges. It is commonly applied in:

1. **Finding the minimum cost to connect all nodes in a network (e.g., road or communication networks).**
2. **Designing least-cost spanning networks for computers, electrical grids, etc.**
3. **Network design problems where minimal connection cost is important.**
4. **Solving problems related to graph connectivity with minimum edge weights.**
5. **Creating a network with the fewest edges while maintaining full connectivity.**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Sort all the edges in increasing order by weight.**
- **Use Union-Find (Disjoint Set) to detect cycles and efficiently manage connected components.**
- **Add edges to the MST in order of increasing weight, skipping edges that would form a cycle.**
- **Kruskalâ€™s algorithm is typically more efficient when dealing with sparse graphs.**
- **The time complexity of Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm is O(E log E) due to edge sorting and Union-Find operations.**
