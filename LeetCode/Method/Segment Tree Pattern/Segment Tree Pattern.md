### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Segment Tree Pattern?**  
The **Segment Tree** approach is useful when solving problems that involve **range queries and updates** on arrays or sequences. It is commonly applied in:

1. **Efficient range queries (sum, minimum, maximum, greatest common divisor, etc.).**
2. **Dynamic interval operations such as range updates and point queries.**
3. **Problems that require multiple updates to an array and queries for certain ranges.**
4. **Applications in competitive programming that involve processing intervals or subarrays efficiently.**
5. **Solving problems like range sum queries, range minimum queries, and more.**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Build a Segment Tree to preprocess data for fast range queries and point updates.**
- **Segment trees can perform range queries in O(log N) time, making them highly efficient.**
- **Lazy propagation can be used to efficiently handle range updates without visiting all elements.**
- **Store results in leaves and compute intermediate results in internal nodes for O(log N) query performance.**
- **Segment Tree is ideal for problems where multiple updates and queries are needed simultaneously.**
