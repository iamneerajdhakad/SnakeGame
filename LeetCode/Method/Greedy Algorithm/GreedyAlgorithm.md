### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Greedy Algorithm Approach?**  
The **Greedy Algorithm** technique is useful when a problem can be solved by **making a series of locally optimal choices** that lead to a globally optimal solution. It is commonly applied in:  

1. **Optimization problems where making the best local choice results in the best global solution.**  
2. **Scheduling problems (e.g., selecting the maximum number of activities).**  
3. **Graph problems like Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Shortest Path.**  
4. **Resource allocation problems (e.g., coin change, interval scheduling).**  
5. **Huffman encoding and other compression techniques.**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Sort the data appropriately** before applying the greedy strategy.  
- **Choose the locally optimal solution at each step** without reconsidering previous steps.  
- **Only use Greedy if the problem exhibits the **Greedy Choice Property** (making a local choice doesnâ€™t affect the global optimal solution) and **Optimal Substructure** (an optimal solution to a subproblem leads to an optimal solution to the whole problem).**
