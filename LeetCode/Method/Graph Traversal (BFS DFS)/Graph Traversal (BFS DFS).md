### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS) Approach?**  
**Graph Traversal** (Breadth-First Search [BFS] or Depth-First Search [DFS]) is fundamental for solving problems that involve exploring or searching through graphs, grids, or trees. It is commonly applied in:

1. **Exploring all nodes in a graph or tree (using DFS or BFS).**
2. **Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph (BFS).**
3. **Detecting cycles in a graph (using DFS).**
4. **Finding connected components in an undirected graph (using BFS or DFS).**
5. **Solving problems involving traversal of grids (e.g., flood fill, maze problems).**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **BFS** is ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs since it explores level by level.
- **DFS** is useful for exploring deeper levels and backtracking (e.g., solving puzzles, maze problems).
- **Use iterative BFS/DFS for large graphs to avoid stack overflow issues in recursive DFS.**
- **For BFS, use a queue for efficient level-wise exploration.**
- **For DFS, use a stack or recursion to explore deeper nodes.**
