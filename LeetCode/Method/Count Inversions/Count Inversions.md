### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Count Inversions Approach?**  
The **Count Inversions** technique is useful when solving problems related to **sorting** and **order preservation**. An inversion in an array is a pair of indices \(i, j\) such that \(i < j\) and \(arr[i] > arr[j]\). It is commonly applied in:  

1. **Counting the number of inversions in an array.**  
2. **Determining the degree of unsortedness in an array.**  
3. **Improving merge sort to count inversions while sorting.**  
4. **Checking if a sequence can be sorted by a limited number of swaps.**  
5. **Solving problems related to the number of pairs in an array that are out of order.**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Use a modified Merge Sort to count inversions while sorting the array in O(N log N) time.**  
- **For each element in the array, count how many subsequent elements are smaller than it.**  
- **For brute force, use a nested loop to check each pair of elements, but optimize it using merge sort for better performance.**  
- **When elements are already close to sorted, a more efficient method can reduce unnecessary comparisons.**
