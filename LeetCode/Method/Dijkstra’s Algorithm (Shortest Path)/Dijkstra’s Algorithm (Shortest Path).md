### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use Dijkstra's Algorithm (Shortest Path)?**  
**Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** is used to find the **shortest path** from a **single source** to all other nodes in a **weighted graph** where all edge weights are non-negative. It is commonly applied in:

1. **Finding the shortest path in road networks (e.g., Google Maps).**
2. **Optimal routing in communication networks.**
3. **Solving problems related to finding the minimum cost in graphs with non-negative edge weights.**
4. **Finding the fastest route or least cost in transportation networks.**
5. **Shortest path calculations in games or simulations with weighted paths.**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Use a priority queue (min-heap) to select the next node with the smallest tentative distance.**
- **Always update the shortest path of a node after processing all its neighbors.**
- **Ensure to track visited nodes to avoid redundant processing.**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm has a time complexity of O(E log V) when using a priority queue.**
