### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Two Pointers Approach?**  

The **Two Pointers** technique is useful when dealing with **sorted arrays, linked lists, or problems involving pairs**. It is commonly applied in:  

1. **Searching for pairs** that meet a condition (e.g., two numbers summing to a target).  
2. **Merging sorted lists** efficiently.  
3. **Removing duplicates** from sorted arrays.  
4. **Reversing or modifying sequences in-place** (e.g., reversing a string).  
5. **Partitioning an array** (e.g., separating even and odd numbers).  

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Use Two Pointers instead of nested loops** to reduce **O(NÂ²) complexity** to **O(N)**.  
- **Move pointers intelligently**:  
  - If elements are **sorted**, use a **left & right pointer**.  
  - If working on **linked lists**, use **fast & slow pointers**.  
  - If iterating through **one array**, use a **single pointer approach** with different speeds.

## ðŸŸ¢ **7 Easy Problems (Two Pointers)**
1. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays**  
2. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**  
3. **Reverse a String (In-place)**  
4. **Move Zeroes to End of Array**  
5. **Valid Palindrome** (Ignoring non-alphanumeric characters)  
6. **Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays**  
7. **Two Sum (Sorted Input - Find Pair)**

## ðŸŸ¡ **5 Medium Problems (Two Pointers)**
1. **3Sum (Find triplets summing to zero)**  
2. **Container With Most Water** (Max Area between two heights)  
3. **Trapping Rain Water** (Optimized approach using Two Pointers)  
4. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**  
5. **Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag Algorithm - 0s, 1s, 2s sorting)**

## ðŸ”´ **3 Hard Problems (Two Pointers)**
1. **4Sum (Find quadruplets summing to target)**  
2. **Sliding Window Maximum (Using Deque + Two Pointers)**  
3. **Minimum Window Substring (Finding the smallest substring that contains all given characters)**  

These problems will help you **master Two Pointers**, gradually moving from simple to complex cases. ðŸš€ Let me know if you need explanations for any of them!
