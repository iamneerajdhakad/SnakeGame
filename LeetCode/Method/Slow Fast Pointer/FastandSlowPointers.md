### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Fast and Slow Pointers Approach?**  

The **Fast and Slow Pointers** (also called **Tortoise and Hare**) technique is useful for problems that involve **linked lists or cyclic patterns**. It is commonly used in:  
1. **Detecting cycles in linked lists or arrays** (Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection).  
2. **Finding the middle of a linked list efficiently.**  
3. **Checking if a linked list is a palindrome.**  
4. **Detecting duplicate numbers in arrays when values are within a fixed range.**  
5. **Finding intersections in cycle-related problems.**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Move one pointer faster than the other** (e.g., one moves 1 step at a time, the other moves 2 steps).  
- **Detect cycles efficiently in O(N) time without extra space** using Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection.  
- **Find key points in lists and sequences (middle, cycle start, duplicates, etc.)** with minimal memory usage.
