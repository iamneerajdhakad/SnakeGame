### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Binary Search Approach?**  
The **Binary Search** technique is useful when dealing with **sorted data or monotonic functions** where the answer space can be reduced by half in each step. It is commonly applied in:  

1. **Searching in sorted arrays or lists.**  
2. **Finding an element in a rotated sorted array.**  
3. **Finding the square root, cube root, or nth root of a number.**  
4. **Finding the first/last occurrence of an element.**  
5. **Optimization problems where a function is increasing/decreasing.**  
6. **Searching for a boundary condition (e.g., smallest/largest possible value satisfying a condition).**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Instead of linear search (O(N)), use Binary Search (O(log N)).**  
- **Use left and right pointers** to reduce search space by half in each step.  
- **For problems without explicit sorting, check if the function is monotonic** (i.e., non-decreasing or non-increasing).  
- **Can be applied on index-based search or answer-based binary search.**
