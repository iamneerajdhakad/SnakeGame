### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Flood Fill Approach?**  
The **Flood Fill** technique is useful when solving problems that involve **exploring connected regions in a grid or graph**, often used for **image processing or pathfinding**. It is commonly applied in:  

1. **Filling connected regions in a 2D grid (e.g., coloring areas in a grid or image).**  
2. **Finding connected components in a grid or graph.**  
3. **Solving maze problems (finding paths in a grid).**  
4. **Determining the size or shape of a region in a grid.**  
5. **Flood-fill algorithms in game development (e.g., for terrain generation or region filling).**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) for flood fill operations in grids.**  
- **Use a queue for BFS or a stack/recursion for DFS to explore neighboring cells.**  
- **Track visited cells to avoid redundant operations and infinite loops.**  
- **For large grids, ensure to use an iterative approach (avoid recursion depth issues).**
