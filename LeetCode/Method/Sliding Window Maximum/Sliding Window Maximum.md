### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Sliding Window Maximum Approach?**  
The **Sliding Window Maximum** approach is used to find the **maximum value** in a **sliding window** of a given size as it moves through an array or sequence. It is commonly applied in:

1. **Finding the maximum value in a subarray of fixed length.**
2. **Solving problems involving continuous sequences, such as moving averages or streaks.**
3. **Dynamic window size problems where the window slides over time (e.g., stock prices).**
4. **Optimizing queries in scenarios where the window needs to be adjusted dynamically.**
5. **Problems requiring the calculation of a moving maximum or minimum value over a window.**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Use a deque (double-ended queue) to store indices of elements in the window, ensuring that elements are ordered by their value.**
- **Remove elements that are no longer in the window from the front of the deque.**
- **Ensure that the deque always contains elements in decreasing order for easy access to the current maximum value.**
- **Sliding window maximum problems can be solved in O(n) time by maintaining this deque structure.**
