### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Topological Sort Approach?**  
The **Topological Sort** technique is useful when solving problems that involve **dependency resolution** in **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**. It is commonly applied in:  

1. **Task scheduling problems where tasks have dependencies.**  
2. **Finding a valid order of courses in course prerequisite problems.**  
3. **Checking if a sequence of events can be completed without conflicts.**  
4. **Dependency resolution in software package installations.**  
5. **Detecting cycles in a directed graph (if topological sorting is not possible, there is a cycle).**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Use Kahnâ€™s Algorithm (BFS-based) or DFS-based topological sorting.**  
- **Keep track of in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each node.**  
- **Process nodes with in-degree zero first and reduce in-degree of their neighbors.**  
- **Detect cycles by checking if all nodes are processed in the final order.**
