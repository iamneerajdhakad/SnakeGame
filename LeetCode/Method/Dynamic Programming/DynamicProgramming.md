### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach?**  
The **Dynamic Programming (DP)** technique is useful when solving **optimization problems** that involve **overlapping subproblems** and **optimal substructure**. It is commonly applied in:  

1. **Optimization problems where recursive solutions lead to excessive recomputation.**  
2. **Problems involving decision-making at each step with multiple possibilities.**  
3. **Counting problems (e.g., ways to reach a target, unique paths in a grid).**  
4. **Subsequence problems (e.g., Longest Common Subsequence, Longest Increasing Subsequence).**  
5. **Partitioning problems (e.g., Partition Equal Subset Sum, Palindrome Partitioning).**  
6. **Knapsack-type problems (e.g., 0/1 Knapsack, Unbounded Knapsack).**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Use memoization (top-down) or tabulation (bottom-up) to store results of subproblems.**  
- **Identify the recurrence relation (formula for solving subproblems).**  
- **Optimize space complexity where possible by using rolling arrays instead of full DP tables.**  
- **Use bitmasking techniques for some DP problems (e.g., Traveling Salesman Problem).**
