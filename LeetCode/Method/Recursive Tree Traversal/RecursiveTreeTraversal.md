### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Recursive Tree Traversal Approach?**  
The **Recursive Tree Traversal** technique is useful when solving problems related to **binary trees and n-ary trees**, where **recursive depth-first exploration** is required. It is commonly applied in:  

1. **Traversing binary trees (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder).**  
2. **Finding properties like height, depth, and diameter of a tree.**  
3. **Checking if a tree satisfies a certain condition (e.g., balanced, symmetric).**  
4. **Finding the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a tree.**  
5. **Pathfinding problems (e.g., root-to-leaf sum paths).**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Use recursion to explore left and right children in binary trees.**  
- **Use a helper function with parameters to carry extra information (e.g., current depth, sum).**  
- **Avoid redundant recursive calls by storing computed values in a dictionary (memoization).**  
- **Use iterative traversal (with a stack) when recursion depth is too large.**
