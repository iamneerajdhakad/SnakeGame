### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Sliding Window Approach?** 
 
The **Sliding Window** technique is useful when dealing with **contiguous subarrays or substrings** and optimizing problems related to **fixed or variable window sizes**. It is commonly applied in:  
1. **Finding maximum/minimum sum subarrays** of a given size.  
2. **Finding the longest/shortest substring that satisfies a condition.**  
3. **Problems involving frequency/count of elements in a window.**  
4. **Optimizing brute-force solutions that involve checking all subarrays.**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- Instead of recalculating values for every subarray, **maintain a sliding window** and **update it dynamically** as you move through the array.  
- **Fixed Window:** Use for problems where window size is known.  
- **Variable Window:** Expand and contract the window **using two pointers** to optimize space and time complexity.  
- **Optimizes brute-force O(NÂ²) solutions to O(N)** by avoiding redundant calculations.

## ðŸŸ¢ **7 Easy Problems (Sliding Window)**
1. **Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K**  
2. **Find All Anagrams in a String**  
3. **Longest Repeating Character Replacement**  
4. **Check if String Contains All Vowels in a Substring**  
5. **Contains Duplicate II** (Check if duplicates exist within K distance)  
6. **Subarray Product Less Than K**  
7. **Smallest Subarray with a Sum Greater Than a Given Value**

## ðŸŸ¡ **5 Medium Problems (Sliding Window)**
1. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**  
2. **Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters**  
3. **Sliding Window Maximum (Using Deque for Efficiency)**  
4. **Permutation in String** (Check if one string is a permutation of another)  
5. **Longest Subarray with Sum Divisible by K**
