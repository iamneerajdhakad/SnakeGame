### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Palindrome Checking Approach?**  
The **Palindrome Checking** technique is useful when solving problems that involve **checking if a string, number, or sequence reads the same forwards and backwards**. It is commonly applied in:  

1. **Checking if a string is a palindrome.**  
2. **Checking if a number is a palindrome.**  
3. **Finding the longest palindromic subsequence in a string.**  
4. **Finding the longest palindromic substring in a string.**  
5. **Detecting palindromes in sequence problems (e.g., DNA sequences, number sequences).**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Use a two-pointer approach to compare characters from the beginning and end.**  
- **For string palindromes, use a single pass from both ends, stopping once mismatches are found.**  
- **For longest palindromic substring, use dynamic programming or expand-around-center approaches.**  
- **For palindrome subsequences, use a dynamic programming approach to find the longest subsequence that is a palindrome.**

2. **Longest Palindromic Subsequence (Find the Longest Palindrome Subsequence in a String)**  
3. **Valid Palindrome II (Can You Make It a Palindrome by Removing One Character?)**  
4. **Palindrome Partitioning (Split a String into Palindromes)**

2. **Palindrome Permutation (Can the String Be Rearranged to Form a Palindrome?)**  
3. **Min Cut Palindrome Partitioning (Min Number of Cuts to Form Palindromes)**
