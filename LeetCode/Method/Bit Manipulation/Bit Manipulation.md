### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Bit Manipulation Approach?**  
The **Bit Manipulation** technique is useful when solving problems that involve **binary representations, set operations, and mathematical optimizations**. It is commonly applied in:  

1. **Finding unique elements in an array using XOR (e.g., single number problems).**  
2. **Checking whether a number is a power of two, three, etc.**  
3. **Counting the number of set bits (1s) in a binary representation.**  
4. **Generating subsets efficiently (Power Set using Bitmasking).**  
5. **Performing fast mathematical operations like multiplication/division using shifts.**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Use XOR to find the single non-duplicate number in an array (O(N) time, O(1) space).**  
- **Use bitwise AND (`&`) to check if a number is a power of two (`n & (n - 1) == 0`).**  
- **Use bitwise OR (`|`) and XOR (`^`) for flipping bits in toggling operations.**  
- **Use left shift (`<<`) and right shift (`>>`) for fast multiplication/division by powers of two.**  
- **Use bit masking to efficiently generate all subsets of a given set.**
