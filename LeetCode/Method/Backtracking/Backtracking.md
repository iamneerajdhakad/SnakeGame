### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Backtracking Approach?**  
The **Backtracking** technique is useful when solving **combinatorial, constraint-based, and decision-making problems** where you need to explore multiple possibilities systematically. It is commonly applied in:  

1. **Generating all possible combinations, permutations, or subsets.**  
2. **Solving constraint satisfaction problems (e.g., Sudoku, N-Queens).**  
3. **Finding paths in a maze (Graph traversal problems).**  
4. **Optimizing brute-force solutions that require exploring all possibilities.**  
5. **Partitioning problems (e.g., Palindrome Partitioning).**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Prune unnecessary branches** using constraints (e.g., if a condition is violated, stop exploring that path).  
- **Use recursion with state tracking** to backtrack when needed.  
- **Use memoization in some cases to avoid repeated calculations.**  
- **Try to construct partial solutions first and extend them instead of generating all possible ones.**
