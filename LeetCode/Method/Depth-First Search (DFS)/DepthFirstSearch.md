### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Depth-First Search (DFS) Approach?**  
The **Depth-First Search (DFS)** technique is useful when solving **graph traversal, tree-based, and pathfinding problems** where deep exploration is required before backtracking. It is commonly applied in:  

1. **Graph and tree traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder in trees).**  
2. **Finding connected components in an undirected graph.**  
3. **Solving pathfinding problems in mazes, grids, and graphs.**  
4. **Topological sorting in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).**  
5. **Detecting cycles in directed and undirected graphs.**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Use recursion (implicit stack) or an explicit stack for iterative DFS.**  
- **Mark visited nodes to avoid infinite loops.**  
- **Use backtracking in cases where multiple choices exist (e.g., pathfinding).**  
- **For weighted graphs, DFS alone is not ideal for shortest path problems (use Dijkstraâ€™s or Bellman-Ford instead).**
