### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use Fast Exponentiation?**  
**Fast Exponentiation**, also known as **Exponentiation by Squaring**, is used to compute large powers of numbers in an efficient way. It is commonly applied in:

1. **Computing large powers modulo a number, especially in number theory and cryptography.**
2. **Solving problems that involve calculating large numbers or powers with constraints (e.g., modular exponentiation in RSA).**
3. **Optimizing recursive functions or problems that require exponential calculations (e.g., Fibonacci numbers, powers of numbers).**
4. **Efficient computation of large powers in algorithms, such as matrix exponentiation or fast computation in dynamic programming.**
5. **Handling operations that would otherwise result in overflow or excessive computation time.**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Divide and conquer**: Break down the exponentiation problem by recursively halving the exponent and squaring the base.
- **Modular arithmetic**: Often, calculations are done modulo a number to prevent overflow and to ensure that the result remains manageable.
- **Time complexity is O(log n)** where n is the exponent, which is much more efficient than the naÃ¯ve O(n) approach of repeated multiplication.
- **For negative exponents, calculate the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive exponent.**
