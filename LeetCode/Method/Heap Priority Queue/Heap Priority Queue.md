### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Heap / Priority Queue Approach?**  
The **Heap / Priority Queue** technique is useful when solving problems that require **efficient retrieval of the smallest or largest elements** in dynamic datasets. It is commonly applied in:  

1. **Finding the k-th largest or smallest element in an array efficiently.**  
2. **Merging multiple sorted arrays or lists.**  
3. **Scheduling problems (e.g., task scheduling, meeting rooms).**  
4. **Finding the shortest path in weighted graphs (Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm).**  
5. **Solving problems that involve continuous dynamic sorting (e.g., median in a stream).**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Use a Min-Heap for efficiently retrieving the smallest elements (Python: `heapq`).**  
- **Use a Max-Heap (by storing negative values in a Min-Heap) for retrieving the largest elements.**  
- **Maintain a fixed-size heap for k-th element problems (reduces sorting overhead).**  
- **Use a heap to optimize graph problems (Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, Primâ€™s MST).**  
- **When dealing with a dynamic stream of numbers, use two heaps (Min-Heap + Max-Heap) for median calculations.**
