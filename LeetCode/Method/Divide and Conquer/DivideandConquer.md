### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Divide and Conquer Approach?**  
The **Divide and Conquer** technique is useful when a problem can be **broken into smaller subproblems** that are solved independently and then combined to get the final result. It is commonly applied in:  

1. **Sorting problems (Merge Sort, Quick Sort).**  
2. **Searching problems (Binary Search).**  
3. **Computational problems involving recursion (Exponentiation, Matrix Multiplication).**  
4. **Finding Closest Pair of Points in a 2D Plane.**  
5. **Solving problems on trees and graphs efficiently.**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Break the problem into smaller independent subproblems.**  
- **Solve each subproblem recursively.**  
- **Combine the results efficiently to form the final solution.**  
- **Improves brute-force solutions by reducing time complexity, often from O(NÂ²) to O(N log N).**
