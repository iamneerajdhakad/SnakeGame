### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Trie Pattern?**  
A **Trie** (or **Prefix Tree**) is a tree-like data structure used to store strings in a way that allows for fast retrieval. It is commonly applied in:

1. **Autocomplete systems or dictionary lookups.**
2. **Storing and searching for prefixes of strings efficiently.**
3. **Solving problems that require efficient string matching (e.g., regular expression matching).**
4. **Dynamic prefix matching in search engines and routers.**
5. **Implementing spell checkers or word suggestions.**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Tries offer efficient insertion, deletion, and searching in O(m) time complexity, where m is the length of the string being processed.**
- **Use a Trie when you need to quickly access strings by their prefixes, making it faster than brute-force search in arrays or lists.**
- **Tries consume more memory due to the need for storing child pointers, but are very efficient for problems requiring prefix search.**
- **Trie nodes typically store characters and links to child nodes, and each path represents a word or part of a word.**
