### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm?**  
**Floyd-Warshall Algorithm** is used to find **shortest paths** between all pairs of nodes in a **weighted graph** (including negative weights, but no negative weight cycles). It is commonly applied in:

1. **Finding the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph.**
2. **Calculating all pairs shortest path in dense graphs.**
3. **Handling negative edge weights efficiently, as long as no negative weight cycles exist.**
4. **Solving transitive closure problems, such as reachability between nodes.**
5. **Analyzing graph connectivity and distance properties in weighted graphs.**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm works by iteratively relaxing all pairs of nodes through each intermediate node.**
- **It is ideal for graphs where you need to compute shortest paths between all pairs, especially in dense graphs.**
- **It has a time complexity of O(VÂ³), where V is the number of vertices, making it less efficient for large graphs.**
- **Avoid it for sparse graphs with many nodes and edgesâ€”other algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s may be more efficient.**
