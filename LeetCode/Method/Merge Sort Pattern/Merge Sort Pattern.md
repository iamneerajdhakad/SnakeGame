### ðŸ“Œ **When to Use the Merge Sort Pattern?**  
**Merge Sort** is a **divide-and-conquer** sorting algorithm that divides the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together. It is commonly applied in:

1. **Sorting large datasets** where efficient sorting is required, especially with linked lists.
2. **Sorting arrays with guaranteed O(n log n) time complexity, even in the worst case.**
3. **Handling datasets that may not fit entirely into memory (e.g., external sorting).**
4. **Sorting elements in parallel processing environments (as it is well-suited for divide-and-conquer strategies).**
5. **Solving problems that involve merging multiple sorted arrays or lists.**

### ðŸ”¥ **Optimization Strategy**  
- **Divide the array into two halves and recursively sort each half.**
- **Merge the two sorted halves together using a linear scan.**
- **Merge Sort has a guaranteed time complexity of O(n log n), making it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms for large datasets.**
- **Merge Sort is stable, meaning equal elements retain their relative order after sorting.**
- **It is not in-place, requiring extra memory for merging (O(n) space complexity).**
